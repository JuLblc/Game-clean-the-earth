# Module 1 | Project: Clean the earth up

## Introduction
This is a super cool exercise that I did at the end of the first module of Ironhack. The first project is designed to apply the principles (HTML, CSS & JS basics, responsive Web Design using Flexbox) I have been taught since the start of the bootcamp.
To do so, I created a friendly shooting game using canvas.

**How to play:**
- Start the game
- Try to splash as many moving targets as possible - Anticipate their move!
- You have 1 minute - Do your best!
- Don't let you surrender otherwise the game is over!
- You can shoot max. 5 water ammunition. 
  If you hit a target or if the ammo is out of the screen, your water tank get refill!
- The more targets you hit, the harder to reach them become and the more points you score!!

_Side note:_ Make sure to turn on the sound for even more fun! :sound:
